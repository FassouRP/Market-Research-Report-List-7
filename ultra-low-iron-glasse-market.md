<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Ultra-low-iron Glasse Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Rolled Glass</li><li>Float Glass</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The ultra-low-iron glass market includes two primary types: rolled glass and float glass. Rolled glass is produced by passing molten glass through rollers, resulting in a uniform thickness and smooth surface, making it ideal for applications requiring optical clarity. Float glass, on the other hand, is made by floating molten glass on molten tin, creating a flat, distortion-free surface. Both types are prized for their high transparency and low iron content, making them suitable for architectural, automotive, and decorative purposes.</p></p>
