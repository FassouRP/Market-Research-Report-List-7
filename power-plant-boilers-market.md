<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Power Plant Boilers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pulverized Fuel</li><li>Circulation Fluidized Bed</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The power plant boilers market primarily consists of two types: Pulverized Fuel (PF) boilers and Circulating Fluidized Bed (CFB) boilers. PF boilers utilize finely ground coal mixed with air to facilitate efficient combustion and energy production, making them suitable for large-scale power generation. In contrast, CFB boilers enhance combustion efficiency by circulating a bed of fuel and inert material, allowing for a wider range of fuel types and lower emissions. Both technologies are essential for optimizing energy output and environmental performance in power generation.</p></p>
