<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Flocculant Blocks Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Positive Charge</li><li>Negative Charge</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Flocculant blocks are used in water treatment processes and can be classified into two main market types based on their charge: positive charge and negative charge. Positive charge flocculants, typically cationic, attract negatively charged particles, aiding in the coagulation and settling of suspended solids in water. In contrast, negative charge flocculants, or anionic, interact with positively charged contaminants, promoting particle aggregation. Each type is selected based on the specific characteristics of the wastewater and the desired treatment outcome.</p></p>
